Extract information from old oil and gas textual reports to make it safer and easier to abandon oil wells. We are building a digital assistant that can provide different research services to well abandonment engineers. Our digital assistant will be able to redraw wellbore diagrams based on data in our abandonment knowledge graph.

## Business Case
During a well abandonment engineers need access to everything that was done to a well, a lot of this data for older wells is only in old drilling reports, and it takes considerable time to read old reports and rebuild well diagrams and it looks like the US is about to do a lot of these well abandonments in the future.

According to the EPA, there are over 3 million abandoned oil and gas wells in the USA. Worse, about 2 million of these wells have not been plugged, and may be responsible for polluting aquifers and drinking water, for surface spills, and for health problems. Methane, more damaging than CO2, can escape a well and contribute to global warming. Plugged wells leak roughly 100 times less pollutants than unplugged abandoned wells. So 2 million unplugged wells are prime candidates for reclamation.
Using updated well plugging costs leads to a range of $300 - $435 billion to reclaim all the abandoned wells across the USA, according to the US Government Accountability Office. Itâ€™s a huge amount of money.
